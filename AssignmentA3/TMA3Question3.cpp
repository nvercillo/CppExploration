 DOCUMENTATION
 
 Program Purpose:
 	Demonstrate proper format for documentation, test plans and comments.
    Demonstrate understanding of basic c++ classes, inheritance,
    and function and operator overloading.


 Compilation:
 (OPTION 1: Manual)
 Compile: g++ TMA3Question3.cpp -o TMA3Question3
 Execution: ./TMA3Question3
 
 (OPTION 2: Makefile)
 Execution: make run3
 Delete Compiled Object: make clean3

 Notes: in Cygwin, main must return type int
 
 Classes: 

    POINT: 
        Description: 
            Used to represent a coordinate point on the cartesian plane.

        Methods:
            Point class has two constructors, one is used for null points
            
        Operator Overloading:
            For two points, the sign "+", is used to add points, "-" is used to subtract (vector addition and subtraction)
            The "*" is used to find the slope of two points
            The || is used to find the absolute value of distance between two points

    SHAPE:
        Description:
            Used as the base/ parent class for Triangle, Circle and Rectangle.
            Circumference, area and the coordinates for a surrounding boundary rectange is calculated here

    TRIANGLE:

        Constructor:  
            Used to initalized the 3 points of the triangle and bool indicating if its a triangle or not
        
        Function Overloading:
            
            Area is calculated here taking the parameter bool is_triangle. This function recreates the triangle in a cartesian in a way which is easier to calculate area
            
            Circumference is also overloaded taking the parameter is_triangle again.
            
            Display - outputs to the console using the overloaded functions above
 
    CIRCLE:

        Constructor:  
            Used to initalized point A which is the center of the circle and the radius r
        
        Function Overloading:
            
            Area is calculated here taking the parameter of in radius.
            This is calculated using the equation area = Ï€ * r^2

            Circumference is also overloaded taking the parameter radius again.

            Boundary Rectangle points generator function is also overloader taking paramter radius.

            Display - outputs to the console using the overloaded functions above

    RECTANGLE:

        Constructor:
            Used to initalized all 4 points of the rectangle


Structs: 

    PARALLELOGRAM:
        
        Description: 
            Basic struct to contain the four points of a parallelogram.
        
 
Variables:

    (   in main() function  )
    String - shape holds the type of shape, t, c , or r
    point_array - contains all the points for the shape
    letters - contais letters used in for loop to indicate which point 
            coordinates are to be entered for 
    int x1, y1 - represent the integers of the coordinates for each point
    rectangle, triangle, circle - represent their respective derived class objects.
    radius - represents radius for circle entered

************************************
 Discussion:
    For the boundary rectangle function, the enclosing of any shape was implied to be inclusive (as it was not explictly stated in the question). 
    This means that for any shape, the boundary rectangle can include one or more points of the shape.
    
    Also for this program there is the restriction that all points must be integeral values.
    It was not stated in the question how the points should be entered by the user so this was implicitly assumed.

    There is not restriction on how the rectangle is rotated and the rectangle can be rotated at any angle, so long as it's points have an integral value
